The First National Generic Sampling and Education Program
</P>
<P>
Dedicated to Quality Pharmaceutical Care at Lower Cost
</P>
<P>
FRANKLIN LAKES, N.J., Nov. 14 /PRNewswire/ -- Merck-Medco, one of the
nation's leading providers of prescription drug care serving one in four
Americans, today announced the launch of Generics First, the first nationwide
program to promote the use of generic prescription drugs through a unique
generic drugs sampling and education program.
</P>
<P>
The Generics First program will provide physicians with additional tools
and information to help patients gain first-hand experience with generic
medications.  Generic medicines have the same active ingredients as brand-name
medicines, but cost on average 30-to-60 percent less.
</P>
<P>
&quot;We believe it is our responsibility to provide health plan sponsors with
innovative programs that can reduce the rising costs of and improve access to
high-quality pharmaceutical care,&quot; says Dick Clark, president of Merck-Medco.
&quot;With the availability of important new generic medicines over the next few
years, we now have a unique opportunity to substantially reduce the cost of
care, while maintaining the highest quality.  To put this in perspective, just
a one percent increase in the use of generic drugs equates to a more than $200
million savings for our plan sponsors and their members.&quot;
</P>
<P>
How the Program Works
</P>
<P>
Initially, the Generics First program will target four of the largest
therapeutic areas -- antihypertensives, anti-infectives, gastrointestinal and
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS).  A team of Merck-Medco
pharmacists will meet one-on-one with physicians at large group practices in
select cities to discuss the availability of under-utilized, high-quality
generic drugs.  The pharmacists will provide the latest information on the
status of brand-name medicines and the availability of new generic medicines.
In addition, for the first time ever, physicians will have access to free
samples of commonly prescribed generic medications through a simple, free
mail-order system.
</P>
<P>
In the first year, the program will target over 7,700 physicians
nationwide, with 6,000 receiving direct mailings and 1,700 receiving monthly
visits from the registered pharmacists.  As a result, it is estimated that the
Generics First message will reach more than 15,000 community-based physicians
and more than 25 million patients.  Moreover, the program is designed to reach
all patients not just those covered by a Merck-Medco serviced plan.
</P>
<P>
&quot;Physicians play a vital role in helping patients keep prescription drugs
within their reach,&quot; says Glen Stettin, M.D., Vice President, Clinical
Affairs, Merck-Medco.  &quot;By providing physicians with access to samples,
Generics First allows people to experience first-hand that generic medications
have the same therapeutic benefits at a significant savings.&quot;
</P>
<P>
In fact, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires generic
drugs to contain the same active ingredients at the same strength and dosage
form as their brand-name equivalents.  In addition, generic manufacturers must
comply with the same rigid federal standards for quality and purity as
brand-name manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
&quot;General Motors recognizes that enrollees want and need more information
about the safety and efficacy of generic drugs,&quot; says General Motors Assistant
Director of Health Care Plans Robert Moroni.  &quot;Through Generics First,
Merck-Medco has taken an organized approach to help patients and physicians
understand that generic drugs are safe and as effective as brand name drugs.&quot;
</P>
<P>
Generics First builds on the success of Merck-Medco's 1999 campaign with
the National Consumers League to heighten consumer acceptance of generics.  A
study, which was completed as part of that effort, showed that 90 percent of
patients would take a generic drug as an alternative if recommended by a
physician, and yet less than 50 percent of the 1,000 patients surveyed said
their doctors had spoken to them about generics.
</P>
<P>
Generic drugs, which are available for about half of all prescribed
medications, are going to increase in number as newer brand-name drugs'
patents expire.  Generic drugs save consumers money through lower
out-of-pocket costs or co-payments and are more economical for plan sponsors.
Of the over 370 million prescriptions managed by Merck-Medco annually, nearly
40 percent are for generic medications.
</P>
<P>
Merck-Medco is the leading provider of comprehensive, quality, affordable
prescription drug care in the United States. An independently managed
subsidiary of Merck &amp; Co., Inc., Merck-Medco serves the needs of more than 65
million, or nearly one-in-four Americans.  Merck-Medco manages some 370
million prescriptions per year for its clients through its 12 mail service
pharmacies and retail pharmacy networks. Merck-Medco's clients include major
corporations, Blue Cross-Blue Shield groups, insurance carriers, health
maintenance organizations, government health plans and unions.  More
