   Stuttgart (dpa) - Headsets are practical: they leave your hands
free while telephoning. It gets even better if the
headphone/microphone combo work wirelessly with your cell phone.

</tx>
<ta><p>   One way for phone makers to offer this is through wireless
Bluetooth technology. Yet as devices get smaller and smaller and
begin to incorporate high design elements from other cell phones,
cell phone users run the risk of looking like a cyborg.

</p><p>   Oliver Jungklaus from Plantronics, a Germany-based manufacturer,
estimates that some 85 per cent of headsets sold are used in
conjunction with a mobile telephone.

</p><p>   Network gamers and Internet telephoners are another target group
who use the microphone on the computer as well. In principle there is
no technical difference between headsets for a PC and those for a
cell phone, Jungklaus explains.

</p><p>   In order for Bluetooth-ready devices to communicate with one
another, they have to speak the same language: &quot;Consumers are
therefore advised to check before making a purchase that their
cell phone offers a Bluetooth headset profile, and potentially a
hands-free profile for wireless telephoning in a car,&quot; explains
Torsten Gabriel, Sales Director at Nokia&apos;s Duesseldorf offices.

</p><p>   The Bluetooth profile reflects interfaces for specific
applications: printing, network connections, transferring image
data or to listening to music over a Bluetooth headset.

</p><p>   The last function will interest cell phone owners looking to
play back MP3 or other audio files in stereo. Torsten Gabriel
feels that the technologies in this area aren&apos;t quite standardised
yet. It is therefore highly probably that stereo headsets currently
on the market will only work correctly with stereo cell phones from
the same manufacturer.

</p><p>   Plantronics recently introduced a stereo Bluetooth headset that
can be connected to stereo sets using an included adapter, known as a
dongle.

</p><p>   Yet listening to music won&apos;t cause the user to miss a phone call.
&quot;Multipoint&quot; technology insures that incoming calls are switched
through. With a manufacturer&apos;s suggested retail price of 179 euro
(214 dollars), the Pulsar 590 A is most definitely towards the high
end of the market.

</p><p>   Good Bluetooth headsets with a simpler options package can already
be found for around 50 euro, says Bernhard Jodeleit from the
Stuttgart magazine &quot;Connect&quot;.

</p><p>   Regardless of the category, one crucial step must be taken- trying
out the headset before buying.

</p><p>   &quot;It&apos;s a bit like buying shoes,&quot; Jodeleit says: Even the prettiest
and most expensive designer headsets can pinch in uncomfortable ways.
After all, no two ears are completely alike.

</p><p>   Once consumers start looking closely at different headset models,
a number of differences will become clear: This includes the
construction, the workmanship, and the weight.

</p><p>   Headsets are currently called light if they weigh 20 grammes or
less. Because not all users want to wear the headset on the right
side of their heads, it&apos;s also a benefit if the device can be worn on
either side.

</p><p>   The buyer should also pay attention to the workmanship: &quot;Devices
from name brands are not automatically particularly stabile,&quot; says
Jodeleit. &quot;You should hold the headset in your hand once before
testing it out.&quot;

</p><p>   Miniaturisation is also part of the Bluetooth headset scene. This
increases the distance between microphone and mouth. In many cases
that takes a negative impact on sound quality, Jodeleit feels.

</p><p>   &quot;We&apos;re trying to make up for it through so-called noise
cancelling,&quot; says Oliver Jungklaus from Plantronics. That is a
process for filtering out environmental noise.

</p><p>   Better chips are required to make it work. Torsten Gabriel from
Nokia feels that the microphones are so good that the spoken words
come across well from one conversation partner to another. When in
doubt, simply try it out.

</p><p>   Since Bluetooth headsets by nature have no cables to provide
power, they usually need rechargeable batteries. While some cheap
models do use standard non-rechargeable batteries, as a rule Liuthium
Ion batteries are used. Five hours of talk time is a benchmark
minimum.

</p><p>   Telecommunications expert Bernhard Jodeleit recommends
paying special attention to how a headset is recharged. Headsets from
cell phone manufacturers in particular can often be recharged using
the same device as the cell phone itself. That is helpful on longer
trips since only one charger needs to be brought along.

</p><p>   This option is available from Nokia, for example. &quot;We do
include a separate charging device for the headset, though,&quot;
says sales director Torsten Gabriel. After all, some consumers use
Nokia headsets with cell phones from other makers.

</p><p>   Regardless of which headset a buyer chooses, Torsten Jungklaus
offers one piece of advice: The buyer should attempt to link
the cell phone and headset there in the store prior to
purchase. &quot;If you can&apos;t get it to work right away, then ask a
salesman&quot;.
